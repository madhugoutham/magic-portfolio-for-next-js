## Overview

In this project, I developed and implemented a suite of machine learning models designed to analyze satellite imagery for predicting cancer prevalence. By combining advanced deep learning techniques with traditional computer vision methods, the solution provides a robust framework for extracting and interpreting critical visual features from large-scale data.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Designed and integrated five distinct ML models to analyze over 1 million satellite images.
- **Computer Vision Techniques**: Utilized OpenCV to extract salient features from high-resolution imagery, ensuring the models capture relevant visual data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved prediction accuracy by 35% while reducing data processing time by 40%, enabling more efficient real-time analysis.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Engineered a system capable of processing large volumes of data, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow**: For constructing and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: To process and extract features from satellite imagery.
- **Deep Learning Techniques**: Employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and feature extraction.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing model complexity with processing speed was a key challenge. Integrating traditional computer vision techniques with modern deep learning approaches required careful tuning and extensive experimentation. This project underscored the importance of scalable model architectures and efficient data pipelines when handling large-scale satellite data.

## Outcome

The developed pipeline successfully forecasts cancer prevalence using satellite imagery, providing valuable insights that can support public health initiatives. The project demonstrates the potential of combining machine learning and computer vision to address complex challenges in healthcare and urban planning.
