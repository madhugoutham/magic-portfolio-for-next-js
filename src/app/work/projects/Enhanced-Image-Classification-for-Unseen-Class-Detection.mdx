## Overview

This project involves developing a novel hybrid framework that integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with segmentation techniques to improve the detection of unseen classes in image classification tasks. The approach was designed to enhance feature representation and bolster the robustness of models when encountering novel data.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines GAN-based data augmentation with segmentation-enhanced feature extraction to improve the model's ability to recognize and classify unseen classes.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Incorporates mechanisms to dynamically balance the influence of synthesized and real data during training, optimizing performance across diverse image sets.
- **Scalability**: Engineered to handle large-scale image datasets, ensuring robust performance even as data volume increases.
- **Performance Boost**: Demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy and reduction in misclassification rates for novel classes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: Utilized for constructing and training both the GAN and segmentation models.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image pre-processing, data augmentation, and feature extraction.
- **Deep Learning Libraries**: Additional libraries were employed to optimize training routines and evaluate model performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

Merging two distinct methodologies—GANs for data augmentation and segmentation for feature enhancement—presented unique challenges. Balancing the contributions of both techniques required extensive hyperparameter tuning and experimentation. This project underscored the importance of adaptive learning strategies in managing data variability and enhancing model generalization, especially when dealing with classes that were previously unseen.

## Outcome

The resulting framework markedly improved the detection of unseen classes, leading to a more robust and adaptable classification model. This advancement not only pushed the boundaries of traditional image classification but also provided a scalable solution applicable to dynamic real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future innovations in hybrid model architectures.
